	We've written some recipes that demonstrate how to solve common problems with OkHttp. Read through them to learn about how everything works together. Cut-and-paste these examples freely; that's what they're for.

Synchronous Get
Download a file, print its headers, and print its response body as a string.

The string() method on response body is convenient and efficient for small documents. But if the response body is large (greater than 1 MiB), avoid string() because it will load the entire document into memory. In that case, prefer to process the body as a stream.

  private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

  public void run() throws Exception {
    Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url("https://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt")
        .build();

    try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
      if (!response.isSuccessful()) throw new IOException("Unexpected code " + response);

      Headers responseHeaders = response.headers();
      for (int i = 0; i < responseHeaders.size(); i++) {
        System.out.println(responseHeaders.name(i) + ": " + responseHeaders.value(i));
      }

      System.out.println(response.body().string());
    }
  }
Asynchronous Get
Download a file on a worker thread, and get called back when the response is readable. The callback is made after the response headers are ready. Reading the response body may still block. OkHttp doesn't currently offer asynchronous APIs to receive a response body in parts.

private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

  public void run() throws Exception {
    Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url("http://publicobject.com/helloworld.txt")
        .build();

    client.newCall(request).enqueue(new Callback() {
      @Override public void onFailure(Call call, IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
      }

      @Override public void onResponse(Call call, Response response) throws IOException {
        try (ResponseBody responseBody = response.body()) {
          if (!response.isSuccessful()) throw new IOException("Unexpected code " + response);

          Headers responseHeaders = response.headers();
          for (int i = 0, size = responseHeaders.size(); i < size; i++) {
            System.out.println(responseHeaders.name(i) + ": " + responseHeaders.value(i));
          }

          System.out.println(responseBody.string());
        }
      }
    });
  }
Accessing Headers
Typically HTTP headers work like a Map<String, String>: each field has one value or none. But some headers permit multiple values, like Guava's Multimap. For example, it's legal and common for an HTTP response to supply multiple Vary headers. OkHttp's APIs attempt to make both cases comfortable.

When writing request headers, use header(name, value) to set the only occurrence of name to value. If there are existing values, they will be removed before the new value is added. Use addHeader(name, value) to add a header without removing the headers already present.

When reading response a header, use header(name) to return the last occurrence of the named value. Usually this is also the only occurrence! If no value is present, header(name) will return null. To read all of a field's values as a list, use headers(name).

To visit all headers, use the Headers class which supports access by index.

  private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

  public void run() throws Exception {
    Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url("https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues")
        .header("User-Agent", "OkHttp Headers.java")
        .addHeader("Accept", "application/json; q=0.5")
        .addHeader("Accept", "application/vnd.github.v3+json")
        .build();

    try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
      if (!response.isSuccessful()) throw new IOException("Unexpected code " + response);

      System.out.println("Server: " + response.header("Server"));
      System.out.println("Date: " + response.header("Date"));
      System.out.println("Vary: " + response.headers("Vary"));
    }
  }
Posting a String
Use an HTTP POST to send a request body to a service. This example posts a markdown document to a web service that renders markdown as HTML. Because the entire request body is in memory simultaneously, avoid posting large (greater than 1 MiB) documents using this API.

  public static final MediaType MEDIA_TYPE_MARKDOWN
      = MediaType.parse("text/x-markdown; charset=utf-8");

  private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

  public void run() throws Exception {
    String postBody = ""
        + "Releases\n"
        + "--------\n"
        + "\n"
        + " * _1.0_ May 6, 2013\n"
        + " * _1.1_ June 15, 2013\n"
        + " * _1.2_ August 11, 2013\n";

    Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url("https://api.github.com/markdown/raw")
        .post(RequestBody.create(MEDIA_TYPE_MARKDOWN, postBody))
        .build();

    try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
      if (!response.isSuccessful()) throw new IOException("Unexpected code " + response);

      System.out.println(response.body().string());
    }
  }
